Bias-corrected genetic correlation estimators of cross-trait polygenic risk scores (PRS)

# Description

This tutorial details the steps of obtaining bias-corrected genetic correlation estimator using cross-trait polygenic risk scores. The preprint could be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01301. Briefly, the genetic correlation between two complex traits estimated by PRS can be biased towarded zero. We quantify the asymptotic limit of this bias and propose the bias-corrected estimator of genetic correlation.

There are three steps to obtain the
