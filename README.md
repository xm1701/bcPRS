Bias-corrected genetic correlation estimators of cross-trait polygenic risk scores (PRS)

# Description

This tutorial details the steps of obtaining bias-corrected genetic correlation estimator using cross-trait polygenic risk scores. The preprint could be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01301. Briefly, the genetic correlation between two complex traits estimated by cross-trait PRS can be biased towarded zero. We quantify the asymptotic limit of this bias and propose the bias-corrected estimator of genetic correlation. 

# Overview

There are three steps to obtain the bias-corrected estimator of genetic correlation:

1. Construct the raw cross-trait polygnic risk scores. We recommend to use genetic variants (i.e., SNPs) after linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based pruning (or clumping). No thresholding is required. That is, all pruned SNPs are use to constructe the polygenic risk score.
